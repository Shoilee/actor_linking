# Overview
This repository contains a set of Python scripts and experiments designed to perform various string matching tasks. The scripts provided cover a range of matching techniques, including exact string matching, intial+surname(abbraviation) matching, surname matching and fuzzy string matching,.

## File Descriptions
matchwithabbreviation.py: This script is dedicated to abbreviation matching. It implements a method to match strings based on abbreviations, allowing for efficient comparison of abbreviated terms.

### matchexactstring.py: 
This script deals with exact string matching. It provides a straightforward method to match strings precisely, without considering any variations or similarities.

### matchwithabbreviation.py: 
This script is dedicated to initial+surname matching. It implements a method to extract initials from a given name or a name with specific patterns. It intelligently handles various cases, ensuring accurate extraction and formatting of initials.

### matchsurname.py: 
This script focuses on surname matching. It provides functionality to compare and match surnames, considering variations and common misspellings.

### matchfuzzystring.py: 
The script matchfuzzystring.py is designed for fuzzy string matching. It employs algorithms that allow for matching strings that are similar but not necessarily identical, considering typos, variations, and other discrepancies.

### main.py: 
The main.py file serves as the entry point for executing and testing the string matching scripts. It may include sample use cases or demonstrations for each matching technique.

### exp300.py: 
This script represents Experiment 300, which might involve specific configurations or variations of the matching algorithms. Please refer to the script for detailed information on the experiment.

### exp202.py: 
Similarly, exp202.py represents Experiment 202. This file likely contains specific settings, data, or methodologies related to the corresponding experiment. Refer to the script for detailed insights.

## Usage
